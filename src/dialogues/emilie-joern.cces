Emilie > ASTONISHED: Oooh~... what's ahi tuna? # Totally not ripped from emilie-shizuka in New Home DLC  ;)

Emilie > ASTONISHED: Wow, exotique!!
Joern > SMILE: Indeed.\. You cook it as you eat and make it as seared as you like.

Joern > SMILE: Around \c[1]700 degrees\c[0].
Lea > SHOCKED: ...?!
Emilie > SWEATY_SMILE: ...\! Seems dangerous to put it on a table, non?
Joern > DEFAULT: It is.
